# Programming languages cource projects

This repository contains the code for the laboratory assignments and projects of the "Programming languages" course taken during the third semester in 2023.

## Project ADA - Consumer/Producer simulation

The program simulates a garden shop, where producers create their products at random times and send them to the buffer. Each producer specializes in manufacturing a specific type of product. If there is space available in the buffer, the product is accepted.

Consumers place orders for sets of multiple products at random times. In the sample program, three different sets are predefined, and each consumer can order any of these sets.

The buffer releases a set when it has the necessary number of products to assemble it. After a set is released, its components are removed from the buffer.
